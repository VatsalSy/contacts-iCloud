## Features

- Supports multiple phone numbers (up to 3) and email addresses (up to 3) per contact
- Preserves contact types (e.g., "Mobile", "Home", "Work")
- Handles both full names and structured names (given name/family name)
- Creates a CSV format that's ready for Google Contacts import
- Properly escapes special characters for CSV format

## Requirements

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd contacts-iCloud
```

2. Build the package:

## Usage

Run the tool by providing two arguments:
1. Path to the directory containing your .vcf files
2. Path where you want to save the output CSV file

```bash
swift run contacts-iCloud ./contacts output.csv
```

For example, if your .vcf files are in a directory called "contacts" and you want to save the CSV as "google-contacts.csv":
```bash

This format is compatible with Google Contacts' import feature.
